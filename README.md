# AutomateColdEmails
A repository that has a python script to help scrape websites for emails and automate cold emails for internships/job search. 

Make sure to put in your own email and password(you can also  modify it to use environment variables to hide password). You may also need to modify file path and name. This tools scrapes a particular link and finds the emails on the website. You can then choose the particular email and send a cold email to the hiring manager of the company. This is a scirpt I think every college student should have.
